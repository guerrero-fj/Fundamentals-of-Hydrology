# Welcome to Fundamentals of Hydrology! 
# (Summer 2022)

## Description:

Get familiar with the basic concepts of the science of water. Through this class you will acquire the conceptual and practical tools necessary to become effective water resources professionals in a rapidly changing world.

## Outcomes:

At the end of this class you will be able to:

* Perform basic exploratory analysis of water cycle environment in an open-source programming interface.
* Conduct basic regression analysis of water quality variables in watersheds with contrasting land uses.
* Present and communicate technical and scientific concepts related to hydrology to non-technical audiences.

## Learning Objectives:

* Knowledge of the techniques for measuring and analyzing hydrologic and water quality data.
* An understanding of the processes involved in the hydrologic regime and its ecological implications.
* An understanding of statistical predictive models applied in hydrology and water quality analysis.
* Cultivate an appreciation for the role of water in linking multiple systems in the landscape.
* Become familiar with current scientific paradigms guiding cutting-edge research in hydrology.

## Our Notebooks

Most of our data exploration and analysis will be done in the RStudio environment using R Notebooks. I will provide a Notebook for each session, e.g., streamflow, precipitation, water quality, etc. Most of our assignments will be connected to these Notebooks. The downloable versions below are always up to date. 

* [Notebook 0](https://github.com/guerrero-fj/Fundamentals-of-Hydrology/blob/main/Notebook_0.Rmd)
* [Notebook 1](https://github.com/guerrero-fj/Fundamentals-of-Hydrology/blob/main/Notebook_1.Rmd)

### How to access the content of these notebooks:
1. Click on the link to the notebook above
2. Once at the corresponding page click on the icon "Copy raw contents" (see below)

3. Open a new notebook in RStudio and paste the content there. Save this file as dd-mm-yy_notebook_n_last,. For example to have the latest version of Notebook_1 after a class session on June 23, 2022. You would save the file as 23_06_22_notebook_1_last
