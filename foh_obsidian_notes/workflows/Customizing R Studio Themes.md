You can customize how [[RStudio]] looks. To do so, you can go to Tools->Global Options -> Appeareance and then select among the available optios for RStudio theme, Zoom, Editor font, Editor font size, and Editor theme. 

You can also further customize the Editor theme by visiting the [online theme editor](https://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com/#!/editor/local/Vibrant%20Ink) and explore multiple combinations. I particularly like dark themes, and the one I'm currently using is [Vibrant Ink](https://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com/#!/editor/theme/Vibrant%20Ink)

Have fun!
