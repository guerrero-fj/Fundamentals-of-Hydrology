What is [[RStudio]] ?  Technically is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that allows you to develop applications (e.g., computer programs) with the help of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). In other words, is a creative space that allows anyone who wants to create a computer program, simple or complex, to do it in a way that is very intuitive. It also allows you to see your partial results as you build your code. 

Since [[RStudio]] is oriented to make your experience as an user more productive and enjoyable, you can organize its interface in multiple ways, like [[Customizing R Studio Themes]].
