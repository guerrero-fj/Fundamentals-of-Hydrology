# Fundamentals of Hydrology: Streamflow

Today, we are going to explore stream flow data. These data span several decades and are part of a Long Term Ecological Research Forest in Oregon. The [H.J.Andrews LTER](https://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/) is located in the Oregon Cascades. But before looking at these data, we need to install some packages that are going to make it easier for us

## Setting up

```{r}
#install.packages("ggplot2","reshape","lubridate","gridExtra","grid","plyr","dplyr",
#                 "nlme","doBy","MASS","lsmeans","CarData","utils","cowplot","ggExtra")
```

## Loading packages

Once we have installed the packages, we need to load them into our workspace, so they can do their magic for us. Let's start with a great one: ggplot2. [ggplot2]() is one of the most complete packages for data visualization, if you are curios about more details, take a look at the webpage.  To load a package we wil use the command "library". You need to do this just once, so I normally load my packages at the begining of my session in r. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```


## Loading the data

A detailed explanation of these datasets can be found at the [H.J.Andrews LTER](https://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/) webpage. More context about our study case can be found in this [MURAL]() for one of my recent scientific presentations. We will go over this study case in class.

```{r}
hjg <- read.csv("220621_fho_hjandrews.csv")
summary (hjg)
```


Let's take a look at the raw discharge data. 

```{r}
ssn_plot <- ggplot(hjg, aes(y=uq.cm, x=wd,color=as.factor(ws)))+
  geom_point(alpha=0.8,size=3.5)+
  ylab("Unit discharge (cm)") +
  xlab("Water day")+
  theme(axis.text=element_text(colour="black",size=14),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 20),
        axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor= element_line(colour = "gray", linetype = "dotted"), 
        panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "gray", linetype = "dashed"),
        panel.border = element_rect(fill=NA, colour = "black", size=1),
        panel.background=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.length = unit(0.254, "cm"),
        axis.ticks = element_line(colour = "black", size=1), 
        axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"),
        legend.position = c(.90,.90),
        legend.direction = "vertical",
        legend.background = element_rect(fill=alpha(0.1)),
        legend.title = element_blank())+
  facet_wrap(~ws)
ssn_plot
```

Another look at these data from a frequency/probabilistic perspective:

```{r}
ssn_plot <- ggplot(hjg, aes(x=uq.cm,color=as.factor(ws), fill =as.factor(ws)))+
  geom_density()+
  ylab("Unit discharge (cm)") +
  scale_x_log10()+
  theme(axis.text=element_text(colour="black",size=14),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 20),
        axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor= element_line(colour = "gray", linetype = "dotted"), 
        panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "gray", linetype = "dashed"),
        panel.border = element_rect(fill=NA, colour = "black", size=1),
        panel.background=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.length = unit(0.254, "cm"),
        axis.ticks = element_line(colour = "black", size=1), 
        axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"),
        legend.position = c(.90,.90),
        legend.direction = "vertical",
        legend.background = element_rect(fill=alpha(0.1)),
        legend.title = element_blank())+
  facet_wrap(~ws)
ssn_plot
```




```{r}
#Checking season assignment plot
ssn_plot <- ggplot(hjg, aes(y=uq.cm, x=wd,color=as.factor(ssn)))+
  geom_point(alpha=0.8,size=3.5)+
  ylab("Unit discharge (cm)") +
  xlab("Water day")+
  theme(axis.text=element_text(colour="black",size=14),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 20),
        axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor= element_line(colour = "gray", linetype = "dotted"), 
        panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "gray", linetype = "dashed"),
        panel.border = element_rect(fill=NA, colour = "black", size=1),
        panel.background=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.length = unit(0.254, "cm"),
        axis.ticks = element_line(colour = "black", size=1), 
        axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"),
        legend.position = c(.90,.90),
        legend.direction = "vertical",
        legend.background = element_rect(fill=alpha(0.1)),
        legend.title = element_blank())+
  facet_wrap(~ws)

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

In a notebook file text not preceded by any symbols is interpreted as plain text. One of the most versatile symbols is the hash (#). It will accomplish multiple functions depending on how is used. You can used hashes to introduce format in your text. For instance:

"#" + Space + text = A big heading

# A big heading

"##" + Space + text = A smaller heading

## A smaller heading

"###" + Space + text = An even smaller heading

### An even smaller heading

Hashes can also be used within a code chunk to add comments to the code. For instance

```{r}
plot(cars)# a plot of distance against speed
```

The asterisk is another helpful symbol. You can make a simple bulleted list with asterisks

* First item
* Second item

An even put in a picture (the file image.jpg needs to be in the same folder/directory as this file)

![](water_cycle.jpg)

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

## Your homework:

* Change the title of this notebook to Notebook 0
* Change the name of the author for your name (Name + Surname(s))
* Change the date to today's date
* Change the output to word_document
* At the very beginning, add a picture of yourself and below write a short paragraph (three sentences) about your background.
* At the end (before the homework section), add a chunk to plot a histogram of a random sample of size 1000 from a normal distribution including the following lines: x = rnorm (1000); qplot (x)
* Save the output as a word document and submit it to CANVAS
